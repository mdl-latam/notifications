# Notifications

This project aims to be an starter project for a Notification/Events system built on AWS.

## TODO

* Organize code per funcionality
* Make unit tests
* Describe how to use this starter project (cloud formation would be very nice)
* Move code from this repo to the definitive one
* Configure a CI (it would be very nice if the CI tool could build all the infrastructure and then run integration tests)
